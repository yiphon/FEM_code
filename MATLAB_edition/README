This edtion of my FEM codes are just the initial thing I've got since I began to learn FEM.

It can be really easy to write such matrix computing programs with MATLAB. Though some algrithms are improved in writing, many of the organizations and structures need to be revised.

I will rewrite most of the codes in Python. That way I might continue to maintain.
